## Description

This “Special Topics” seminar, [censored](https://thetech.com/2024/08/22/degraff-linguistics-for-domination) as a linguistics course by MIT Linguistics, is an invitation to both sociolinguistics and postcolonial linguistics in a moment of our history when these fields are most relevant for [#MITMensManusEtCor](https://web.mit.edu/fnl/vol/164/williams.htm) toward the [#BetterWorld](https://www.mit.edu/about/mission-statement/) in MIT’s mission statement. Yes, we humans are social beings, and language is one of the main tools for us to interact in society. [Sociolinguistics](https://www.pbs.org/speak/speech/sociolinguistics/sociolinguistics/) is the study of these interactions. As for ["Postcolonial Linguistics,"](https://iacpl.net/jopol/#:~:text=Postcolonial%20linguists%20aim%20to%20provide,theorizing%20created%20by%20Eurocentric%20frameworks.) it seeks to develop innovative models, theories, and analyses for a multipolar, postcolonial world, so we can question the interpretations, conceptualizations, and theories established by (neo-)colonial frameworks. One previous “Special Topics” seminar, in the same format as this one for fall 2024 (with guest speakers generously contributing specialized or insider’s expertise for us to build on), was my fall 2021 course [*24.S96 Linguistics and Social Justice: Language, Education, and Human Rights*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/24-s96-linguistics-and-social-justice-language-education-and-human-rights-fall-2021/).

Our “Special Topics” seminar in fall 2024 fits with recent calls from the *Linguistic Society of America* for linguists to engage in more public-facing outreach on matters of urgent concerns—such as [conflict and peace-making](https://www.lsadc.org/content.asp?contentid=332)—toward a [#BetterWorld](https://www.mit.edu/about/mission-statement/). Indeed there’s a pressing need for our students and colleagues, even beyond linguistics, to learn and practice [“linguistics’ broader value to society.”](https://www.lsadc.org/resources_list.asp?c=12&i=22) In this light, our discussions in the seminar, in interdisciplinary mode and open to all students, staff, and faculty at MIT toward peace and community building, will proceed along two tracks, both of which connect *language* and *linguistics* to “real world” issues implicating human rights and social justice—in the same vein as in the fall 2021 seminar:

### 1) The exclusion vs. inclusion of certain languages in avenues where knowledge and power are created and transmitted

How can linguistics help us create tools for quality education toward total liberation? How can linguistics help counter various sorts of prejudice in the context of education vs. mis-education in Haiti and other communities whose languages are disenfranchised?

Definitions (e.g., what’s “language”? what’s “Creole”? what’s “linguistics”? etc.) play a key role in the ways in which particular languages and their speakers are excluded in education and other venues where knowledge and power are created and transmitted. Language and linguistics are powerful weapons for the making and un-making of hierarchies of power—as illustrated in my work for the past couple of decades, demystifying “[Creole Exceptionalism](http://lingphil.mit.edu/papers/degraff/degraff2005fallacy_of_creole_exceptionalism.pdf)” dogmas, in #MITMindHandHeart mode to help build a [#BetterWorld](https://iacpl.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DeGraff-1.pdf) for Creole speakers and their kin.  This takes us to the second aspect of the seminar—from “Creole Exceptionalism” to various sorts of  “Palestine Exceptions.” 

### 2) The use of language in propaganda in the context of conflicts where words, definitions, phrases, syntactic patterns, etc., are enlisted to political ends to the detriment of academic freedom, freedom of speech, mutual understanding, empathy, peace, community building, social justice, etc.  

One urgent case study is the (mis)use of language in the context of the war on Gaza, and its treatment in the media, in politics, on university campuses, etc., [even right here at MIT](https://mondediplo.com/outside-in/mit-gaza). The goal here, like in the context (above) of linguistics and education, is to exploit linguistics’ unique [vantage points](https://mondediplo.com/outside-in/mit-gaza) for deconstructing the [weaponization](https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2024/06/13/duty-understand-weaponization-language-opinion) of language and, more broadly, the hegemonic and divisive power of language, and for constructively contributing to the foundations of peace and universal respect of human rights worldwide.

One common objective, in both tracks of the seminar, is to analyze how language and linguistics can be used as tools for either hegemony and conflictual propaganda or for human rights, peace, justice, and a better world.

## Suggestions for Participants

It will be helpful if participants, if they can afford the time, can at least browse through suggested readings in advance. And, given the title of the seminar and the historical juncture where we find ourselves, both at MIT and in the larger world, especially in Gaza, let’s think of projects that can actually turn into resources with some degree of practical value in terms of “decolonization and liberation and peace and community building....”
