We will examine the exclusion vs. inclusion of certain languages and their speakers in avenues where knowledge and power are created and transmitted. Additionally, we will explore the use of language and linguistics in propaganda in the context of conflicts where words, definitions, phrases, syntactic patterns, etc., are enlisted to political ends to the detriment of academic freedom, freedom of speech, mutual understanding, empathy, peace, community building, social justice, etc.",
